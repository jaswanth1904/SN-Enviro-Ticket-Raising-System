A modern, high-performance, dual-interface issue tracking and telemetry management system designed specifically for field operations and centralized administration. 

This ecosystem bridges the gap between on-site field engineers (who report issues) and backend administrators (who triage, assign, and resolve anomalies), featuring real-time socket connections and automated email dispatching.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Dual Interface Architecture**: Two entirely separate, purpose-built frontends:
  * **🎛️ Admin Dashboard**: A sleek, glassmorphic React/Tailwind web app for administrators to view live event feeds, manage SLA timers, and analyze ticket status overview charts.
  * **📱 Field Portal**: A highly-responsive, clean, and bordered mobile-first web portal tailored for field workers to instantly report issues, capture GPS locations, and upload photo evidence.
* **⚡ Real-Time Socket Updates**: Instantly pushes new tickets and status updates to the Admin Dashboard without requiring a page refresh.
* **📧 Automated Email Dispatching**: Built-in HTML email automation that instantly notifies assigned technicians when a ticket is delegated to them, and emails resolution logs upon ticket closure.
* **📸 High-Resolution Evidence Tracking**: Secure, clickable high-resolution image attachments for remote diagnostics.
* **⏱️ Dynamic SLA Monitoring**: Automated countdown timers and badge warnings for critical outages and SLA breaches.
